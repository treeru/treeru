# TreeRU

A terminal-based file explorer that lets you browse folder/file structures without an IDE.

Built for use alongside AI CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.).
Split your Windows Terminal (Ctrl+Shift+D) — one side for your terminal, the other for TreeRU.

## Quick Launch — Claude Code (F9 / F12)

No more opening Explorer, copying folder paths, opening a terminal, `cd`, and typing the command manually.

1. Navigate to your project folder in TreeRU
2. Press `F9` to register it as a Claude Code workspace (one-time)
3. From now on, press `F12` anytime → select the workspace → Claude Code launches in a new terminal, ready to go

Works with SSH too — connect via `F10`, navigate to the remote folder, `F9` to register, then `F12` opens a new terminal tab with SSH + Claude Code automatically.

Press `Del` in the `F12` menu to remove a workspace.

## Claude Usage Monitor (F8)

Press `F8` to see your Claude usage in the header bar — session usage with remaining time, and weekly usage percentage.

```
  TreeRU v1073                          Session 12% 2:53 | Weekly 5%  3 SSH hosts
```

- **First press** takes ~3 seconds (launches a headless browser in the background)
- **Subsequent presses** refresh in ~0.4 seconds (reuses the running browser)
- Colors change based on usage: blue (<50%), yellow (50–80%), red (>80%)

**First-time setup:** On the first `F8` press, a Chrome window will open for you to log in to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai). Close it after logging in, then press `F8` again. Your session is saved locally — you won't need to log in again until it expires.

> Requires Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Session cookies are stored in `~/.treeru_claude_profile/`.

## Features

- **Multi-column layout** — Far Manager style, responsive 2–4 columns based on terminal width. Navigate between columns with `←` `→` arrow keys
- **File viewer** — Press `Enter` on a file to view with line numbers. Scroll, copy entire content (`C`), or open in Notepad (`F4`)
- **Multi-select** — `Space` to toggle, `Shift+↑↓` for range select, mouse drag or `Ctrl+Click` for multiple files
- **Mouse support** — Click to navigate, double-click to enter folder, drag to select, Ctrl+Click to toggle
- **F5 File paste** — Copy files in Explorer (Ctrl+C) → paste in TreeRU with `F5`. Works with SSH remote folders
- **SSH/SFTP remote browsing** — Press `F10` to connect to servers from your `~/.ssh/config` (SSH key auth required)
- **Clipboard image auto-save** — Take a screenshot and it auto-saves to the current folder. Works with Windows 11 Print Screen, Snipaste, Win+Shift+S, and more
- **Multi-path copy (Alt+Shift+C)** — Copy selected file paths (comma-separated). Handy for passing paths to AI CLI tools
- **CJK filename support** — Correctly displays CJK (Korean, Japanese, Chinese) filenames
- **Auto-refresh** — Automatically reflects local file changes

## Workflow — Using with Claude Code

Split your terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+D`). Left: Claude Code. Right: TreeRU.

**Passing a screenshot to Claude Code:**
1. Take a screenshot (`PrtSc`, `Win+Shift+S`, Snipaste, etc.)
2. TreeRU auto-saves it to the current folder as `screenshot_....png`
3. Navigate to the file → `Alt+Shift+C` to copy the path
4. Switch to Claude Code → `Ctrl+V` to paste the path
5. Claude Code can now read and analyze the image

**Asking Claude Code to edit a file:**
1. Browse to the file in TreeRU
2. `Alt+Shift+C` to copy the full path
3. Switch to Claude Code → paste → "edit this file"

**Selecting multiple files:**
- Files next to each other: `Shift+↑↓` to range select (highlighted in yellow)
- Files scattered in the folder: `Space` to toggle each one individually (highlighted in yellow)
- With mouse: `Ctrl+Click` to toggle, or drag to range select
1. Select the files you need
2. `Alt+Shift+C` copies all paths (comma-separated)
3. Paste into Claude Code → "review these files"

No IDE needed. No drag-and-drop. Just copy the path and paste.

## Install

### Windows (Installer)
1. Download from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Extract ZIP → run `install.bat` (auto-requests admin)
3. Run `treeru` in a new terminal, or click the desktop icon

> The installer will attempt to install Node.js and Windows Terminal automatically. If it fails, install Node.js manually from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and run `install.bat` again.

> **Note:** If Windows Terminal install/update fails, your Windows Update service (`wuauserv`) may be disabled. Enable it and try again:
> ```powershell
> # Check status
> Get-Service wuauserv
> # Enable and start (admin required)
> Set-Service wuauserv -StartupType Manual
> Start-Service wuauserv
> ```

### Manual
```bash
git clone https://github.com/treeru/treeru.git
cd treeru
npm install
node index.js
```

### Requires
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20.18.1 LTS recommended (v18+ supported)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or Microsoft Edge — required for F8 Claude usage monitor (headless browser). Edge is pre-installed on Windows 10/11
- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701) — required for F9/F12 Claude Code launch. Pre-installed on Windows 11, but update to latest recommended. Windows 10 users must install manually:
  - Microsoft Store → search "Windows Terminal", or
  - `winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal`
- Windows 11 (tested on 25H2) / Windows 10

## Usage

```bash
treeru                        # Start in current directory
treeru C:\Users\me\projects   # Start in a specific directory
```

Split your Windows Terminal with `Ctrl+Shift+D` and run TreeRU on one side.
